# What is enterprise state roaming?

With Windows 10, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users gain the ability to securely synchronize their user settings and application settings data to the cloud.

Enterprise State Roaming provides users with a unified experience across their Windows devices and reduces the time needed for configuring a new device.

*Enterprise State Roaming (ESR) can be enabled only for users*. If device accounts are in a group for which you enable ESR, device accounts are ignored.
