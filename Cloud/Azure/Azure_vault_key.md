# Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application's secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and logging capabilities.

## What can Azure Key Vault do?

Azure Key Vault can help you:

- **Manage Secrets**
  
    You can use Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.

- **Manage encryption keys**

  You can use Key Vault as a key management solution. Key Vault makes it easier to create and control the encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data.

- **Manage SSL/TLS certificates**

  Key Vault enables you to provision, manage, and deploy your public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for both your Azure resources and your internal resources.

- **Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)**

  These secrets and keys can be protected either by software or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.
