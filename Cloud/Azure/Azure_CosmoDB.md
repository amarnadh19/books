# CosmosDB

## Introduction

Azure CosmosDB is the global distributed multimodel database service.

You can elastically and independetly scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions world wide.

Azure CosmoDB provides schema-less data, which lets you build highly respossive and always-on applications to support constant changing data.

At the lowest level, Azure CosmosDB stores data in *Atom-Record-Sequence(ARS)* format.

No SQL Database.

Single milliseconds latency

Automatic updates and patching.

## Benifits

### Guaranteed speed at any scale

- Real-time access with fast read and write latencies globally, and throughput and consistency all backed by SLAs

- Multi-region writes and data distribution to any Azure region with the click of a button.

- Independently and elastically scale storage and throughput across any Azure region – even during unpredictable traffic bursts – for unlimited scale worldwide.

### Simplified application development

- Deeply integrated with key Azure services used in modern (cloud-native) app development including Azure Functions, IoT Hub, AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), App Service, and more.

- Choose from multiple database APIs including the native Core (SQL) API, API for MongoDB, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, and Table API.

- Build apps on Core (SQL) API using the languages of your choice with SDKs for .NET, Java, Node.js and Python. Or your choice of drivers for any of the other database APIs.

- Run no-ETL analytics over the near-real time operational data stored in Azure Cosmos DB with Azure Synapse Analytics.

- Change feed makes it easy to track and manage changes to database containers and create triggered events with Azure Functions.

- Azure Cosmos DB’s schema-less service automatically indexes all your data, regardless of the data model, to deliver blazing fast queries.

### Mission-critical ready

Guarantee business continuity, 99.999% availability, and enterprise-level security for every application.

- Azure Cosmos DB offers a comprehensive suite of SLAs including industry-leading availability worldwide.

- Easily distribute data to any Azure region with automatic data replication. Enjoy zero downtime with multi-region writes or RPO 0 when using Strong consistency.

- Enjoy enterprise-grade encryption-at-rest with self-managed keys.

- Azure role-based access control keeps your data safe and offers fine-tuned control.

### Fully managed and cost-effective

End-to-end database management, with serverless and automatic scaling matching your application and TCO needs

- Fully-managed database service. Automatic, no touch, maintenance, patching, and updates, saving developers time and money.
