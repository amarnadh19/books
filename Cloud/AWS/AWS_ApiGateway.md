# What is APIGateway?

AWS API gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs. 

API acts as a front door for the application to access data, business logic or functionality from the backend services.

It handles all the task involved in accepting and processing up of hundreds or thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization, access control, monitoring and API management.
