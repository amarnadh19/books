# Controlling access to the Kubernetes

Users access the kubernetes APi using *kubectl*, client libraries or by making REST requests.

Both human users and K8 service accounts can be authorized for API access.

    Note:

    Service account:

    A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a pod when you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same NameService.
