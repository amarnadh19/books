# Azure Well-Architected Framework Pillars


Azure has five pillars

	1) Cost Optimization
	2) Operational excellence
	3) Performance efficiency
	4) Reliability
	5) Security

#### Cost Optimization:

Design cloud for cost effective for operations and development.

#### Operational Excellence:

By Taking advantange of modern development practices such as devops you can enable faster development and deployment cycles. You should have good monitoring arch in place so that you can detect failurs and problems before they happen or min time before cutomer notice it.

#### Performance Efficiency:

For architecture to perform well and scalable, it should properly match resources capacity to demand. Generally cloud devices use dynamic scaling based on activity.

#### Reliability:

A successfull cloud environment is designed in a way that anticipates failures at all levels.

#### Security:

We need to secure data from attacks from unknown hackers. The integrity of your data should be protected too, through tools like encryption.


## General design Principles

#### Enable architectural evolution:

No architecture is static. Allow for the evolution of your architecture by taking advantage of new services, tools and technologies when they are available.

#### Use data to make decisions:

Collect data analyze it, and use it to make decisions surrounding your architecture. From cost data, to Performance to user load, using data will guide you to make the right choices in your environment.

#### Educate and enable:

Cloud technology evolves quickly. Educate your development, operations and business teams to help them make the right decisions and build solutions to solve business problems.

#### Automate:

Automation of manual activities reduces operational cost, minimizes error introduced by manual steps and provides consistency between environments.


## Design choices

In an ideal architecutre, you would build the most secure high-performance highly available, and efficient environment possible.
