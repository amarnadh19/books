# Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars

Azure has five pillars

	1) Cost Optimization
	2) Operational excellence
	3) Performance efficiency
	4) Reliability
	5) Security

Cost Optimization:
------------------

Design cloud for cost effective for operations and development.

Operational Excellence:
--------------------

By Taking advantange of modern development practices such as devops you can enable faster development and deployment cycles. You should have good monitoring arch in place so that you can detect failurs and problems before they happen or min time before cutomer notice it.

Performance Efficiency:
-----------------------

For architecture to perform well and scalable, it should properly match resources capacity to demand. Generally cloud devices use dynamic scaling based on activity.
